# golang-repost-bot
This repository will store the code for a Twitter bot written in Golang.

This is my very first Go project. I intend to use it to learn about HTTP server and how to work with JSON in Go.

What this bot does is the following:

* Makes a GET request for a subreddit

* Gets 15 posts

* Checks which posts have 1000 upvotes or more

WIP.
